- 👋 Hi, I’m Lucas. I'm a professor currently working with machine and deep learning techniques for both field spectroscopy data and remote sensing imagery.
- 👀 I’m interested in contributing with data science approaches in multiple remote sensing subfields, including vegetation, precision agriculture, soil, water, and urban monitoring.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced deep learning approaches for remote sensing data, and looking forward to novel methods in this field.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with researchers across the globe with similar interests.
- 📫 You can reach me at my professional e-mail < lucasosco@unoeste.br >. Please feel free to contact me.
